QUESTION: Is the distribution of refugees across Europe Union balanced?
Q: Are there countries that host the majority of refugees?
SUB1: Is the refugees distribution affected by the host country's distance to the refugee's origin country?
SUB2: Is the refugees distribution affected by the host country's wealth?

PACKAGE: Integrate r package - refugees

q - from population - linear graph from 2000 onward of each country + piechart of refugees for each country in 2023
q - bar chart of refugees for each country in 2023 + calibrated bar graph on country size in 2023
q - network graph (not weighted) -> make different size of vertices based on piechart (internal and external movement)
q - network graph (weighted) -> different color of edges based on percentage of refugees of that country transferred (internal movement) + different size of vertices based on total refugees (piechart)
sub1 - find dataset with distance - create correlation graph (distance vs refugees) -> refugees on first trip (no relocation)
sub2 - find dataset on wealth - create correlation graph (wealth vs refugees) -> first trip and relocation

Data cleaning ->
- get data for our objective (only eu countries)
- get data from this century (from 2000 onward)
- transform NA entries to 0
- rename lengthy values
- remove unnecessary columns
